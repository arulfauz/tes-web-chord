        <p class="bagian-lagu">INTRO</p>
        <span class="part-lagu">[Verse 1]</span>
        Do you know what's worth fightin' for
        When it's not worth dyin' for?
        Does it take your breath away
        And you feel yourself suffocatin'?

        <span class="part-lagu">[Verse 2]</span>
        Does the pain weigh out the pride
        And you look for a place to hide?
        Did someone break your heart inside?
        You're in ruins

        <span class="part-lagu">[Chorus]</span>
        One, twenty-one guns
        Lay down your arms
        Give up the fight
        One, twenty-one guns
        Throw up your arms
        Into the sky
        You and I

        <span class="part-lagu">[Verse 3]</span>
        When you're at the end of the road
        And you lost all sense of control
        And your thoughts have taken their toll
        When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul

        <span class="part-lagu">[Verse 4]</span>
        Your faith walks on broken glass
        And the hangover doesn't pass
        Nothing's ever built to last
        You're in ruins

        <span class="part-lagu">[Chorus]</span>
        One, twenty-one guns
        Lay down your arms
        Give up the fight
        One, twenty-one guns
        Throw up your arms
        Into the sky
        You and I

        <span class="part-lagu">[Bridge]</span>
        Did you try to live on your own
        When you burned down the house and home?
        Did you stand too close to the fire
        Like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone?
        <p class="bagian-lagu">SOLO</p>
        <span class="part-lagu">[Verse 5]</span>
        When it's time to live and let die
        And you can't get another try
        Something inside this heart has died
        You're in ruins

        <span class="part-lagu">[Chorus]</span>
        One, twenty-one guns
        Lay down your arms
        Give up the fight
        One, twenty-one guns
        Throw up your arms
        Into the sky
        
        <span class="part-lagu">[Chorus]</span>
        One, twenty-one guns
        Lay down your arms
        Give up the fight
        One, twenty-one guns
        Throw up your arms
        Into the sky
        You and I
